# War-Susceptibility

## Description
A statistical learning project aimed at predicting various war outcomes and effects

## Questions
* Is it possible to predict the emergence of a conflict or a potential war in 20 years based on the presence / absence of conflict / war in subsequent periods from a given year? 

* How do wars end and what factors tend to influence the end? 

* What factors influence the emergence of smaller conflicts or massive wars? 

## Data Sets
* [UCDP Onset Dataset Codebook Version 19.](https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/onset/UCDP_Onset_Dataset_Codebook_19.1.pdf) 
* [UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset Codebook Version 21.1] (https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/ucdpprio/ucdp-prio-acd-211.pdf)
